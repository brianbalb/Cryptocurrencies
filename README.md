# Cryptocurrencies Project 
requested by Martha, Senior Manager of the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting (Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank)

## Tools / Software used
* Software
* Python 3.7
* Scikit-learn 0.24
* HvPlot 0.7.0
* Plotly 4.14.3

## Project Overview

Present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product. Primary purpose for the bank; interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers.

Data preparation, so it will be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she decided to use

* Unsupervised learning was the primary approach since the output is unkownn. 

* A cluster algorithm is used to help determine about investing. 

* Martha will use Data Visualization techniques to share the data results

## Workflow

1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
4. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
5. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
